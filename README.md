dvd_rental_report.sql - Queries the PostgreSQL DVD Rental Database to examine the most loyal customers by number of purchases made and total amount spent. Contains two data transformation tables with differing granularities. A detailed table displays customer information, total purchases by each customer, and total amount spent by each customer. A summary table displays the average purchases made by the top 100 customers and the total amount spent by the top 100 customers. Contains a function that can be used to produce the transformations required for the detailed table, a trigger that updates the summary table based on changes made in the detailed table, and a stored procedure to refresh the data in the detailed and summary tables. Provides actionable insights that can be directed towards customer loyalty programs tailored to high volume purchasers and purchasers that tend to spend more, and sales targets based on the historical averages of high-value customers.
