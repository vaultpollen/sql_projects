dvd_rental_report.sql - Queries the PostgreSQL DVD Rental Database to examine the most loyal customers by total amount spent per month. Contains two tables with differing granularities. A detailed table displays customer information, purchases by each customer, and month of purchase. A summary table displays the top 10 customers by month and total purchase amount. Contains a function that can be used to produce the transformations required for the detailed table, a trigger that updates the summary table based on changes made in the detailed table, and a stored procedure to refresh the data in the detailed and summary tables. Provides actionable insights that can be directed towards customer loyalty programs tailored to high spending purchasers based on the time of year.
